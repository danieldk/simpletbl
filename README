== Introduction ==

simpletbl is a simple transformation-based learner and tagger written
in C++. simpletbl can automatically learn rules from a POS-tagged
corpus, given a set of rule templates. The rules that are produced
can subsequently be used to tag arbitrary text.

simpletbl is licensed under the LGPL version 3, this license can
be found in the COPYING.LESSER file.

== Building simpletbl ==

simpletbl can be built using the scons build tool. On GNU/Linux and
OS/X, you can simply run 'scons' in the top-level directory, and
a simpletbl library will be built, as well as some utility programs.
