== Introduction ==

simpletbl is a simple transformation-based learner and tagger written
in C++. simpletbl can automatically learn rules from a POS-tagged
corpus, given a set of rule templates. The rules that are produced
can subsequently be used to tag arbitrary text.

== Warning ==

I found this source code my archive, and am making it available for
illustrative purposes only. I do not intend to maintain it.

== Building simpletbl ==

simpletbl can be built using the cmake build tool. On GNU/Linux and
OS/X, you can simply run 'cmake' in the top-level directory, followed
by 'make', and a simpletbl library will be built, as well as some utility
programs.
